To obtain an insight into the energy consumption with the introduction of the \confignoc{} changes in \cref{ch:5} and model configuration using external memory we will provide a comprehensive analysis.

When configuring the \graicore{} and processing an input frame, the major components that consume energy are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reading data from the external memory
        \item Transferring data from the external memory to the \confignoc{}
        \item Phits traversing (i.e., hops) through the \confignoc{}
        \item Writing data to the neuron core's SRAM
    \end{itemize}
    \item Processing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Processing the input frame by the model
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
