\section{Future work}
This chapter discusses future work to be done for further improving the analysis

\subsection{Exploring partitioning strategies}

% TODO


\subsection{Parallel configuration/processing}
Explain that we can speed up inference of large models by configuring and processing the partitions in parallel or pipelined.

\subsection{Compiler analysis}
Explain that with a comprehensive analysis of the compiler, we can improve the search for optimal solutions for a model or model partition.

\subsection{Add static power consumption}
Explain that we have only considered dynamic power/energy consumption.
Static power has not been explored.

\subsection{Other memory technologies}
We have only explored two specific memory technologies (DDR).
Using an other memory technology may provide us with better results.
This could be in terms of speed and energy use.

The energy numbers of PCM looks more promising compared to the LPDDR5X memory.
However, a few parameters haven't been considered in this research.
For example, the density (capcity per physical area) of LPDDR5X is higher than PCM.

\subsection{More accurate bandwidth analysis}
We only analyzed the peak effective bandwidth

\subsection{More models}
We should analyze more models to get a more accurate figure
