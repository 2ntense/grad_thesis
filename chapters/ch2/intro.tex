This chapter provides the foundational knowledge and context necessary to understand the core concepts and methodologies in this work.
It begins by introducing fundamental deep learning concepts, including artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks.  
Next, we discuss relevant computer architecture topics such as network-on-chip and external memory.
Lastly, a more in-depth description of the \graicore{} is provided.
