This chapter provides the foundational knowledge and context necessary to understand the core concepts in this work.
The background information presented here establishes an understanding of the underlying technologies used in this work, including artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, network-on-chips, external memory technologies, and the \graicore{}'s design.
A solid foundation in these areas is essential for evaluating design choices and their implications for performance, power efficiency, and overall system design.
