This chapter presents the execution of multiple and large models on the \graicore{}.
It provides an analysis on the requirements for the \confignoc{} to be able to achieve these capabilities.
% TODO Fix
Allowing the execution of multiple models enhances system versatility, allowing the \graicore{} to dynamically switch between models based on the task at hand.
By enabling the execution of larger models, \graicore{} can leverage more accurate and sophisticated AI capabilities, overcoming limitations that restricted the use of memory demanding models.
