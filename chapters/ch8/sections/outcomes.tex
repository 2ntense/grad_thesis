\section{Expected outcomes}
The expected outcome is a partitioning strategy with optimal compiler parameters for each partition that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Minimizes the energy consumption while meeting the target inference latency $T$ and memory capacity $M$ constraints.
    \item Maintains the accuracy of the original large model.
\end{itemize}
