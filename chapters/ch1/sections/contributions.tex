\section{Contributions}
The work presented in this thesis aims to address the challenges associated with the efficient execution of large and multiple models on the \graicore{}.
To achieve this goal, we have made several key contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    A comprehensive analysis of the \graicore{}'s current configuration architecture, highlighting its limitations when executing multiple and large models.
    \item
    Identification of system requirements necessary for enabling execution of these models through extensive analysis.
    \item
    Significant improvements to the \graicore{}'s configuration architecture, focusing on bandwidth enhancements to meet requirements for model execution.
    \item
    Analysis of a model partitioning technique, which enables the execution of large models by dividing them into smaller, more manageable units.
    \item
    Formal definition of the complex problem of partitioning large models for low latency inference, establishing a framework for developing effective solutions.
    \item
    Thorough energy analysis of the system, examining both configuration process and energy consumption associated with processing realistic models.
    \item
    Exploration of potential avenues for further optimization, focusing on improving model configuration efficiency and reducing overall energy consumption.
\end{itemize}
