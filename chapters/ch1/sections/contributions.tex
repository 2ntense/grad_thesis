    \item
    % Requirement analysis of executing multiple and large models on the GrAICore.
    Analysis of executing multiple and large models on the \graicore{}, obtaining requirements for the system to support.
    \item
    % Proposal of improvements to the \confignoc{} for bandwidth improvements to reach high bandwidth configuration
    Proposal of improvements to the \confignoc{} for bandwidth improvements to reach high bandwidth configuration, meeting the requirements.
    \item
    Analysis of model partitioning strategy, enabling the splitting of a large model to make them run on the \graicore{}.
    \item
    Power analysis of the system for configuration and processing of a model with practical models.
    \item
    Analysis of further improvements for configuration efficiency
    \item
    A formal problem description describing complex problem of large model partitioning for energy-efficienct inference on the \graicore{}.
