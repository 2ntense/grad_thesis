To obtain an insight into the power consumption with the introduction of the config NoC changes in \cref{TODO} and model configuration using external memory we will provide an comprehensive analysis.
% To get an approximation of the power consumption when configuring the GrAICore with a model and processing frames with it, we will provide calculations with energy parameters acquired from internal sources.

When configuring the GrAICore and processing an input frame, the major components that consume energy are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Configuration
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Reading data from the external memory
        \item Transferring data from the external memory to the config NoC
        \item Phits traversing (i.e., hops) through the config NoC
        \item Writing data to the neuron core's SRAM
    \end{itemize}
    \item Processing
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Processing the input frame by the model
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
