The config NoC is mainly used for configuration writes to the neuron core memories.
Another use is status monitoring reads while the GrAICore is in operation.
The config NoC is a separate NoC next to the event NoC, which is used for the execution of a model.
It connects all 144 neuron cores via a 2D mesh topology (see \cref{fig:noc}).
The network receives and forwards data using routers at each neuron core.
The config NoC has a single 16-bit wide interface for incoming data from an AXI slave.
Similarly, the links between every two adjacent routers are 16-bit wide. 
The clock frequency of the system is \SI{800}{MHz}.
